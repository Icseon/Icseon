Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### I am Icseon!
My primary skillset lies in the low level architecture of applications in general.  You will usually find me reverse engineering pre-existing technologies to improve upon them or implement my own iterations of the aforementioned. At times, I do develop new applications which I end up publishing for the world to use.

With over a decade of programming experience, I continue to enjoy working on new and exciting technology.\

### Technologies and languages I've worked with and used in production environments

- **Express**\
I use ExpressJS to scaffold a full MVC application and add my own additions on top for purposes such as authentication, authorization and the like through middleware and services.

- **socket.io**\
I use socket.io to replace ExpressJS for when I need realtime communication between the client and server for things like notifications, commands and chat messages.

- **Vue**\
All of my projects since 2019 use Vue as the front end framework to ensure a consistent, quick and fluid user experience, no matter how good your internet connection is.

- **nginx**\
nginx is used in my projects to balance load between multiple web servers and ensure quick serving of static content and additionally acts as a reverse proxy.

- **memcached & redis**\
I store all temporary and disposable data (such as sessions) in server memory to ensure great performance.

- **cloudflare**\
To ensure performance and security of my services, I use cloudflare as a CDN and reverse proxy & dynamic firewall to vend off malicious actors in realtime.

- **fail2ban**\
Used in combination with cloudflare to vend off malicious actors. Logs are automatically analyzed to identify threats.

- **MySQL**\
Starting off as a PHP developer, using MySQL made sense for me. I continue to use MySQL to this day to store data.

- **PHP**\
Including Laravel and Phalcon as well as self made web frameworks. I no longer use PHP in my personal projects.\

- **Java & Kotlin**\
Primarily for Android application development

- **Python**\
Primarily for low level networking, utilizing the power of TCP and UDP sockets to transmit raw data over the net

_Note: I do not use github for version control. I host my own internal git server for that purpose. I may sometimes make older code public_
