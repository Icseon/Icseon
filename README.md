Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### I am Icseon!
My primary skillset lies in the low level architecture of applications in general.  You will usually find me reverse engineering pre-existing technologies to improve upon them or implement my own iterations of the aforementioned. At times, I do develop new applications which I end up publishing for the world to use.

These are mostly personal projects I do aside from my job.

With over a decade of programming experience, I continue to enjoy working on new and exciting technology.\
